# Elektricity

A server designed to make it easy to re-broadcast existing content
as a podcast. Named after [London Elektricity][1] who, among other
things, hosts the [Hospital Podcast][2].

---

The purpose of Elektricity is to take content that exists on the web already,
and turn it into a podcast to consume whenever you want. Specifically,
I'm a huge Drum & Bass head that wanted an easy way to access
[the Bassdrive archives](http://archives.bassdrivearchive.com/) since
the only actual podcast I could find was for Ben XO.

What this server does is essentially just provide you an easy way
to design podcasts and serve them. The intention is not to host the
content ourselves, but tell people where to get the content at.

Future ideas: Turn your mixcloud feed into a podcast?

Repod is currently very bare-bones, but the Requirements file should
be enough to get up and running.
